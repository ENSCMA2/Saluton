## Description
Saluton is a chatbot allows you to practice Mandarin with a conversational partner, and it is customized to your level. 

## Inspiration
Natural language processing is a hot field in the world of technology and artificial intelligence. Also, with increasing globalization and integration of cultures, demand for foreign language learning is on the rise. Most language learning programs have some form of built-in chat function, but they are either scripted or human-led. Our bot aims to address those weaknesses.

## How We Built It
We used Javascript and JSON in Gupshup and deployed our bot to Facebook Messenger. We used Google Translate's API to detect and translate user input and return appropriate responses that have been prepared through natural language processing.
